# Getting Started With Hyperplane
 
Its early days for us at Hyperplane, and as a result our product has some limitations we are working to address. 
We will be using this README as a home for our roadmap, content guidelines, and any other relevant info! 

We are most responsive on our discord: https://discord.gg/Hs4sWQy

## Getting Started 
Fill out the interest form here and a Rep will get back to you within 24hrs(or just message us on the discord): http://bit.ly/hyperplane-signup
1. You will receive your welcome email asking for more info to populate your profile (Photo, bio, etc.)
2. After your profile is populated, you will receive another email with a `SDK` and a `Desktop Application`
3. Install the Desktop Application called `HyperStream`
4. Implement the lightweight SDK into your 3D rendering engine. The SDK changes frequently (its under heavy development) so reach out  

## My First Post
1. Boot up Hyperstream
2. Hook up our SDK into your 3D Engine
3. Run the scene either in Unity Editor or in a live game!

### Setting up the Camera

Currently, we expect the Camera to be set at a position of `(0, 1.6, 0)`. This is so that the scene looks good within our WebXR viewer. We are actively working
on supporting dynamic camera position and appreciate you working with us as we smooth out our rough edges.
